# Dynamic Assessment of Microbial Ecology (DAME)

A shiny app using the R environment to perform microbial analysis of phylogenetic sequencing data.  Dame was specifically designed to work directly with output files from QIIME 1 with as minimal file processing as possible.

The current release (v0.1) assesses α- and β-Diversity measurements, and differential expression analyses of sequencing count data. DAME requires the .BIOM file from QIIME and a .CSV file containing the .BIOM sample labels and metadata (experimental grouping data) associated with each sample. This app utilizes the Shiny framework to allow for dynamic and real-time interaction with virtually all aspects of the data workflow. Where possible, table and graphic outputs utilize D3 for a fully interactive experience.

## Installation

*DAME* can be downloaded and run locally providing that the latest version of R and shiny are installed.  Github launch will install all required packages. Cut and paste the following script into the R console and *DAME* will launch and open in browser.

```r
library(shiny)
runGitHub("ACNC-DAME", "bdpiccolo")
```

## Getting Started

*DAME* requires two files to operate:

1. BIOM file - QIIME output file typically found in the folder (**OTU**) during otu picking method using either of the programs (**pick_open_reference_otus.py**, **pick_closed_reference_otus.py** or **pick_de_novo_otus.py**).

  Note: Use the OTU generated file that has taxonomy details (e.g. **otu_table_mc3_w_tax.biom**).  DAME will fail to recognize OTU table without taxonomy details.

2. BIOM Metadata File - .CSV file containing a column with exact sample labels used in QIIMe analysis and experimental groupings.  It is recommended to re-purpose the original map file used in QIIME analysis.

3. TRE file (optional) - .TRE file, typically found in the same folder (**OTU**) from QIIME output.

BIOM files that are generated through other pipelines (which are in JSON format) must be converted to HDF5 format before loading into *DAME*.

* Convert from biom to txt:

```python
biom convert –i table.biom –o otu_table.txt –to-tsv –header-key taxonomy
```

*	Convert back to biom:

```python
biom convert –i otu_table.txt –o new_ otu_table.biom –to-hdf5 –table-type=”OTU table”
–process-obs-metadata taxonomy
```

## Example of BIOM Metadata 

### Features 

- Utilizes BIOM file to minimize data manipulation steps
- Experimental group selections automatically render 
- Allows user to filter data based on meta-data and/or low abundant sequence reads
- Utilizes Shiny for interactive inputs and reactive tables and graphics
- All tables and graphics are interactive

### Analyses 

- Summary statistics before and after filters:
   * Sample prevalence
   * Total Reads
   * Total OTUs 
   
- α-diversity statistics by taxonomic levels:
   * Calculates observed, chao1, ACE, Shannon, Simpson, Inverse Simpson, Fisher indices.
   * Calculates 1-way or multifactor ANOVAs based on meta-data.
   * Output tables are rendered with the [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) package.
   * Barplots rendered with the [highcharter](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/) package.*
   * All data (α-diversity calculations and statistics) are downloadable.
   
- β-diversity statistics by taxonomic levels:
   * Calculates multiple dissimilarity, distance, and tree based parameters.
   * Calculates several ordination methods, including Principal Co-ordinate Analysis, Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling, and others.
   * Ordination plots rendered with the [scatterD3](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scatterD3/vignettes/introduction.html) package.
   * Tables are rendered with the [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) package.
   
- Differential abundance analysis using Negative Binomial Regression by taxonomic levels:
   * Pairwise comparisons of meta-data using [DESeq2](http://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8) workflow.
   * DESeq2 result table rendered with [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) package.
   * Boxplots displayed with either Total Reads or Percent Abundance and rendered with the [highcharter](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/) package.*
   * All results are downloadable.
